Understanding the signs and seeking prompt medical care is crucial for preventing long-term complications.\n\n## What is a Concussion?\n\nA concussion occurs when the brain is shaken inside the skull due to sudden impact or movement. This can happen during car accidents when:\n- Your head hits the steering wheel, dashboard, or window\n- Your head is jolted forward and backward rapidly\n- The force of impact causes your brain to move within your skull\n\n## Immediate Symptoms\n\nSymptoms may appear immediately or develop over hours:\n\n**Physical Symptoms:**\n- Headache or pressure in head\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Dizziness or balance problems\n- Blurred or double vision\n- Sensitivity to light or noise\n\n**Cognitive Symptoms:**\n- Confusion or feeling \"foggy\"\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Memory problems\n- Slowed thinking\n\n**Emotional Symptoms:**\n- Irritability\n- Anxiety\n- Depression\n- Mood swings\n\n## When to Seek Emergency Care\n\nCall 911 immediately if the person experiences:\n- Loss of consciousness\n- Repeated vomiting\n- Severe or worsening headache\n- Extreme confusion\n- Seizures\n- Unusual behavior\n\n## Medical Evaluation\n\nOur medical team will conduct:\n- Neurological examination\n- Cognitive testing\n- Balance and coordination tests\n- CT scan or MRI if necessary\n- Ongoing monitoring\n\n## Treatment and Recovery\n\n**Immediate Care:**\n- Physical and cognitive rest\n- Gradual return to activities\n- Symptom monitoring\n- Follow-up appointments\n\n**Recovery Timeline:**\n- Most concussions heal within 7-10 days\n- Some may take weeks or months\n- Children and teens often take longer to recover\n- Previous concussions may extend recovery time\n\n## Return-to-Activity Protocol\n\n**Step 1:** Complete rest until symptom-free\n**Step 2:** Light mental and physical activity\n**Step 3:** Moderate activity without symptoms\n**Step 4:** Heavy non-contact activity\n**Step 5:** Full contact practice (if applicable)\n**Step 6:** Return to normal activities\n\n## Preventing Second Impact Syndrome\n\nNever return to activities while experiencing concussion symptoms. A second injury before full recovery can cause:\n- Severe brain swelling\n- Permanent brain damage\n- Death in rare cases\n\n## Long-term Monitoring\n\nSome people may experience post-concussion syndrome with symptoms lasting months. Our team provides:\n- Ongoing neurological monitoring\n- Cognitive rehabilitation\n- Physical therapy for balance issues\n- Psychological support if needed\n\nIf you've been in a car accident, even a minor one, and experience any head injury symptoms, seek medical evaluation immediately.
